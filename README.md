- _Ab initio_ implementation of an ![explainable artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) (XAI) method based on discrepancy maps and receptive field computation in convolutional neural networks from ![Zhou et al., 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6856)
- application to AlexNet and a variant trained by the Silver Sight team on images from a behavioral neuroscience experiment on human orientation in an artificial environment
